Data analysis on video game purchase data
I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items
that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that 
breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

Three observable trends based on the data:
1.	Purchasing analysis (Age) shows that people between ages 20-24 have the highest 
        	Total number of purchases
        	Total purchase Value
    o	It also shows that this same age group has 
        	the second highest average purchase price per item
        	the third highest Ave total purchase person
2.	Non males have the highest
    o	Ave purchase price
    o	Aver total purchase per person
3.	~36% of players in this data set are repeat customers
